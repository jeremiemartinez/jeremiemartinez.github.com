I had the opportunity to give this talk at several conferences in the last year. Slides and speech have been improved month after month, conference after conference.
Slides are available on [Speaker Deck En](https://speakerdeck.com/jeremiemartinez/devops-sur-android-from-one-git-push-to-a-play-store-release) and the video has been released on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O58yq8B3shc).
