On the 10th of November 2015, I had the opportunity to give a talk about Dagger 2 at Droidcon Paris.
Slides are in French and available on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/jeremiemartinez/dagger-2-back-to-basics).
Code from live coding is available on [Github](https://github.com/jeremiemartinez/dagger2_talk).
Finally, the video has been released on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkTST564lA4).

I wanted to thank anyone that attended my talk, it was really a great experience for me to speak at such an important conference. Moreover, it gave me a lot to think about and explore for the following weeksâ€¦
